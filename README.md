# React-Firebase-Authentication
I've been looking for to master modern web development with React. I built an application using React and Firebase. Recently, I bought the ([Fender Acoustic-Electric Guitar](https://goo.gl/pMqX3y)). This app helps newcomers of the guitar world to store their new songs with chords.
<br>
The basis for my application was ([CoderJourney](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMuoDQy61ys)).

## How app works

This app allows users to sign up and authenticate and own the songs that they create. The authentication functionality in Firebase create users and allow them to sign into the application. Moreover, I give our potential users the ability to sign up with email and password or to sign in with Facebook.
